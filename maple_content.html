    <h3>Maple</h3>
    
    <p>Acer(maple) is a genus of trees and shrubs commonly known as maples. The genus is placed in the family Sapindaceae.  </p>
    
    <p>There are approximately 132 species, most of which are native to Asia, with a number also appearing in Europe, northern Africa, and North America.</p>
    
    <p>Most maples are trees growing to a height of 10–45 m (33–148 ft). Others are shrubs less than 10 meters tall with a number of small trunks originating at ground level. Most species are deciduous, and many are renowned for their autumn leaf colour, but a few in southern Asia and the Mediterranean region are evergreen. Most are shade-tolerant when young and are often riparian, understory, or pioneer species rather than climax overstory trees. There are a few exceptions such as sugar maple.[clarification needed] Many of the root systems are typically dense and fibrous, inhibiting the growth of other vegetation underneath them. A few species, notably Acer cappadocicum, frequently produce root sprouts, which can develop into clonal colonies</p>
