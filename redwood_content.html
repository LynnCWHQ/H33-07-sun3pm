<h3>California Redwood</h3>

<p>Sequoia sempervirens (/səˈkwɔɪ.ə ˌsɛmpərˈvaɪrənz/)[3] is the sole living species of the genus Sequoia in the cypress
    family Cupressaceae (formerly treated in Taxodiaceae). Common names include coast redwood, coastal redwood,[4] and
    California redwood.[5] It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living 1,200–2,200 years or more.[6] This
    species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to 115.5 meters (379 ft) in height (without the
    roots) and up to 8.9 m (29 ft) in diameter at breast height. These trees are also among the oldest living things on
    Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an
    estimated 810,000 hectares (2,000,000 acres)[7][8][9] along much of coastal California (excluding southern
    California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.
