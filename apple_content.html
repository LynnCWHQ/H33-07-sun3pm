<h3>Apple</h3>

<p>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are
    the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
    Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were
    brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
    cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.</p>
<p>

    Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently
    lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple
    trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to
    control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting. </p>
