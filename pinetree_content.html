<h3>Pine Tree</h3>

<p>Pine trees are evergreen, coniferous resinous trees (or, rarely, shrubs) growing 3–80 metres (10–260 feet) tall, with
    the majority of species reaching 15–45 m (50–150 ft) tall.[3] The smallest are Siberian dwarf pine and Potosi
    pinyon, and the tallest is an 81.8 m (268 ft) tall ponderosa pine located in southern Oregon's Rogue River-Siskiyou
    National Forest.[4]</p>

<p>A pine is any conifer tree or shrub in the genus Pinus (/ˈpiːnuːs/)[1] of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole
    genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. The Plant List compiled by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Missouri Botanical
    Garden accepts 126 species names of pines as current, together with 36 unresolved species and many more synonyms.[2]
    The American Conifer Society (ACS) and the Royal Horticultural Society accept 121 species. Pine may also refer to
    the lumber derived from pine trees; pine is one of the more extensively used types of wood used as lumber. The pine
    family is the largest family within conifers, and there are currently 818 named cultivars, or trinomials, recognized
    by the ACS.</p>
